<p>Hi! I'm Cordelia Sequeira,</p>
<p>I have been teaching music for over 25 years as a private piano teacher and over fifteen years as a Music for Young Children teacher, in addition to teaching music in schools. My students have played at festivals, accompanied choirs and placed at music competitions. I have prepared students for RCM examinations from the prepatory level up until Grade 10 and have taught all three levels in the rudiments of theory. I enjoy playing, teaching and listening to music. I hope to share the joy of music making with my students who, I hope in turn, will share their love of music with others.</p>
<p>I have completed an LTCL practical in piano and an ATCL practical in voice from the Trinity College of Music London as well as am an MYC certified teacher and a Royal Conservatory of Music Certified Teacher. I have also completed my Bachelor of Education from the University of Toronto. In addition to the above, I have also completed additional qualifications in music from the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>MYC is one the best music programs to introduce your child to music. It is a well rounded program and each class includes elements of rhythm ensembles, ear training exercises, keyboard ensembles, singing, sight-reading, and theory; elements vital to build a strong foundation in music. As Marc Widner, Chief Examiner emeritus, Royal Conservatory Music Examinations aptly states:&nbsp;"The Music For Young Children Program has to be counted as the dominant force in the&nbsp;musical training of&nbsp;young children in Canada today.&nbsp;&nbsp;MYC teachers have found the right balance. They successfully blend the pleasure and joy of music making with the rigor of a&nbsp;well-crafted pedagogical progression."</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you and hope to infuse in your child a love for music and help them embark on a lifelong musical journey.</p>
